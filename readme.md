<center><h1>Small ASN.1 coding / encoding library that works together with my jsonx project</h1></center>

This library follows some ideas from the ASN.1 project but doesn't claim to be conformant in any case. It is simply a tool that can be included into very small devices that can interoperate with jsonx aware projects (See: **jsonx** project in my gitHub).
